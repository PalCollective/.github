# PalCollective تضامن لغزة

This is a digital solidarity initiative for Gaza. It is currently under simultaneous ideation and execution, which brings about an unavoidable amount of chaos. Yet, a few irrationally-committed individuals seem to keep the initiative moving at this time.

The objective of this initative is to do something that is _practically useful_ to the Gazans, _rewarding_ to those inclined to share solidarity with them, and is _either indifferent or stabilising_ (rather than de-stabilising) to the complex and unpredictable "system" of conflict.
